# WallstreetbetsAnalysis


The intent of this project is to examine the wallstreetbets subreddit as compared to the daily movements of key stocks from December 31st, 2020 to February 16th, 2021. GME price soared from aproximately $18.80 to $347.50 in less than a month. This event is significant because it proves that individual investors can influence the markets. The introduction of free and easy investing/trading has brought forth an age where mass movements can sway the markets.
